            "Users are able to pick their parts for their pc, the part picker will guide them through what parts fit together and what parts won't. It gives certain warnings where compatibility may or may not be an issue but there is still something to be aware of. The user gets a live overview of what parts they chose and their respective specifications, what the current for the entire price is and in the end they get a 3D preview of their build to see how much room they have and last but not least They get a URL to their build they can share.", "If users still feel uncomfortable making their own computer, they can check out community builds.",
            "",
            "",
            "You can register and login as a user, you then get the availability to easily see only your own builds and get the option to edit them.",
            "A huge challenge with this project was that there is no consistent open data for computer parts to compare compatibility between parts, therefore I had to create my own version.",
            "If you login as an admin you get access to a backoffice with an entire CRUD system for computer parts. When creating or editing a new part there is a vast list of variables that change if a part is compatible or not. Furthermore there is also a superAdmin role, this role is the same as an admin; the only difference is that superAdmins also have access to a crud system for users."
